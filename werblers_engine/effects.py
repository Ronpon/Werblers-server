"""Effect hooks for monster-specific traits and curses.

Each monster's trait/curse carries an ``effect_id`` string.  Hook
functions keyed by that id are called at the appropriate moments:

* **Strength hooks** — called during combat strength calculation to
  add conditional bonuses (e.g. "+3 Str when wearing no helmet").
* **Movement hooks** — called when a movement card is played to
  modify its value (e.g. "treat all 6s as 1").
* **On-gain hooks** — called once when a trait/curse is first acquired
  (e.g. "discard all weapons", "receive a special item").

Effects that require systems not yet built (minion cards, pack/inventory,
token counters, PvP interactions) are assigned an ``effect_id`` but have
no hook implementation yet — they are logged as "deferred".
